Hi there, glad you made it to my website.
Looks like you found the page where I tell you a little about myself.
My name is Brendan Whitney and I am an avid outdoor enthusiast.
My favorite avenues for exploring the outdoors are skiing and expedition
backpacking.
However,
I also love exploring new sports like sea kayaking, whitewater kayaking, rock
climbing, and trail running.
I try to split my free time enjoying the outdoors and serving to protect it so
that future generations might reap the benefits of quality time outdoors.

Obviously this passion pairs very well with a desire to spend my work days 
behind a computer.
While the connect might be difficult to see at first glance,
I benefit most from being active.
This is where my love of Data Science fits in because difficult problems allow
for my mind to be active.
My particular interest in Data Science focuses on the problem of communicating
difficult concepts in terms that most people can understand.
A large aspect of this problem revolves around simple, informative
visualizations, which is like a fun combination of math and art.
I love it.
The possibilities unlocked by Data Science fascinate me greatly,
and I am beyond excited to see the future progression of this realm.
