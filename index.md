## [Predicting Baseball Game Outcomes](https://brendanwhit.github.io/ds1-final-project/)

_This paper attempts to build a regression model to predict the winner of 
baseball games for the 2018 MLB season.
The regression model is built from two disjoint datasets:
baseball statistics from baseball-reference.com
and weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network.
The text presents initial results from an exploration of the data combined 
to create the full dataset.
Then the regression model is created and analyzed using recursive models
that are trained on the previous games before predicting the games for 
each day of the season.
The model had a predictive power of 55.77%,
which is more predictive than coin flips.
However,
the model did not have more predictive power than just simply choosing
the team with the highest win percentange or Pythagorean score._
